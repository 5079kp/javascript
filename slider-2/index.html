          <h1>Cherry Blossom</h1>
          <p>
            Cherry blossoms, or sakura in Japanese, are the flowers of cherry trees,
            primarily from the Prunus genus. They are renowned for their delicate beauty and are deeply
            symbolic in Japanese culture, representing both the fleeting nature of life and the beauty of
            spring. These trees are not typically grown for their fruit, but rather for their ornamental
            value and the spectacular blooms they produce each spring.
